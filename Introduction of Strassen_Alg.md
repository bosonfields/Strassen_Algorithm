<font face ="Times New Roman"><font size ="4">

+ This is an exercise for Strassen algorithm for Intro to algorithm book

+ In this project, I used three different languages to implement Strassen_algorithm, that is a algorithm for computing matrix multiplication (C/C++, JAVA and Python)

+ For JAVA and C++, I didn't use any package for implementing matrix, I built a Class of matrix to support my work.

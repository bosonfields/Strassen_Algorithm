+ This is an exercise for Strassen algorithm for Intro to algorithm book

+ In this project, I used three different languages to implement Strassen_algorithm, that is a algorithm for computing matrix multiplication (C/C++, JAVA and Python)
+ For JAVA and C++, I didn't use any package for implementing matrix, I built a Class of matrix to support my work.
+ Strassen Algorithm using divide and conquer strategy to divide the matrix, in this case the time complexity of multiply matrix reduced from \\(\Theta (n^{3})\\) to \\(\Theta (n^{lg(7)})\\)
